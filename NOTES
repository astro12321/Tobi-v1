There needs to be a support added for pointers (that points directly in addresses in the packet --> see ex. 2)  
  
There is also more fields to the packet than the one I'm parsing when the Type is SRV (33) (in the Answers section).  
This can be tested with this request: *nslookup -type=srv _http._tcp.deb.debian.org*  


The priority would be to begin working on modifying ICMP/UDP packets to see after how all these problem could be solve, 
because they could need more complexe classes, that would them needs to be easily editable (from a packet viewpoint).
It then makes more sense making sure I can edit packets before beginning doing complex classes that would need to be replace after all.
